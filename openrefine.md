# Data Wrangling with OpenRefine

After ensuring that you've followed the [Preparatory steps](preparation) to install OpenRefine, navigate to the Data Carpentries' [Open Refine for Social Science Data](https://datacarpentry.org/openrefine-socialsci/) workshop page and follow along with the hands-on tutorial. 

***And note*** that though the workshop uses Social Sciences data, the approaches used in this workshop are applicable in many other disciplines.
